  /**
    * That's nice, but why can't we just use ordinary `+` defined for numerical types, for example?
    * For sure we can.
    * Semigroup may be useful if our goal is to provide a convenient rule for aggregating values of some custom type.
    * Or while designing a library | class we may demand a presence of Semigroup to be able to combine values.
    * For example, if we want to combine messages of Response type from different services into a single fat Response
    * without event knowing what's inside.
